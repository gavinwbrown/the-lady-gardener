                        <p>Did you know that the name for a lady who gardens is either a gardenerette or a gardengal, hence the name of my website.
                            Here are some pictures taken on my iPhone of some of my favourite plants and flowers. Whilst by no means an exhaustive 
                            list I hope this will inspire you to maybe try a couple of these plants in your own garden, if you haven't already.</p>

                            flowers. The young leaves are often bronze or red, maturing to dark green. 
                            They contrast beautifully with the small, white jewel-like flowers, 
                            and bees love them.</p>

                            plenty of differences too. Make sure that your dog doesn't eat them though 
                            as they are poisonous to our furry friends.
